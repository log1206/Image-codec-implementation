## Image codec implementation for JPEG
This is a implementation of 2D Fourier transform to further processing the image for compression. Just like introduced in JPEG conpression.
We can also choose quantization number to reduce the data which is less sensetive to human eye. In this simple work, we can show three levels of
reduced image outcome and compare the quality.
Evaluating by quality matrice - PSNR.
